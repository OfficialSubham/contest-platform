This file is my frustration/thoughts got while coding this project

30/1/26
-> So today while doing the signup route i was not able to compile my project even with using gpt and all i was not able to figure it out
in my previous project i had done the same things kind of like using these dependencies
I don't know why but importing things with the extensions like .js .ts there looks kind of odd so i decided to not to do that and tried almost every thing but still not able to do that
these are the things i faced in my previous hotel booking project
Then some how with the help of AI i came to know about the tsup package which compile ts code easily without kind of any folder i saw the compiled code there is actually no imports at all it is just dumping all the code in one index.js file and using it these are the thing of my previous project
Now coming to this project I was not able to figure out how can i compile this project and run then i started to compare this project with my previous project after reading the error i find out OF MY OWN that the error is because of dotenv file then i noticed that my dotenv file dependency was in devdepedencies which kind of vanishes after begin compiled so we mostly install types there then i move it out from there to dependencies then everything works as fine as \*\*\*\*;
